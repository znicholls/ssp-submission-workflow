# CMIP7 ScenarioMIP Offline Runs

Offline (i.e. local) running 
of the CMIP7 ScenarioMIP emissions harmonisation 
and simple climate model (SCM) based climate assessment.
The idea of this directory is to make it possible
for the IAM teams to run the workflow themselves,
to facilitate faster iteration and exploration.

<!---

We recommend having a status line in your repo to tell anyone who stumbles
on your repository where you're up to. Some suggested options:

- prototype: the project is just starting up and the code is all prototype
- development: the project is actively being worked on
- finished: the project has achieved what it wanted and is no longer being
  worked on, we won't reply to any issues
- dormant: the project is no longer worked on but we might come back to it, if
  you have questions, feel free to raise an issue
- abandoned: this project is no longer worked on and we won't reply to any
  issues

-->

## Status

- prototype: the project is just starting up and the code is all prototype

## Installation

We do all our environment management using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
To get started, you will need to make sure that uv is installed
([instructions here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
we found that using uv's standalone installer was best on a Mac).

To create the virtual environment, run

```sh
uv sync
uv run pre-commit install
```

These steps are also captured in the `Makefile` 
so if you want a single command
(and have `make` installed), 
you can instead simply run `make virtual-enviroment`.

Having installed your virtual environment, you can now run commands in your
virtual environment using

```sh
uv run <command>
```

For example, to run a notebook server, run

```sh
uv run jupyter lab
```

Once you have run your notebook server,
you can simply run the notebooks in order.

## Development

<!--- In bigger projects, we would recommend having separate docs where this
development information can go. However, for such a simple repository, having
it all in the README is fine. -->

Install and run instructions are the same as the above 
(this is a simple project, without tests etc. 
so there are no development-only dependencies).

### Contributing

This is a very thin project. There aren't any strict guidelines for
contributing, partly because we don't know what we're trying to achieve (we're
just exploring). If you would like to contribute, it is best to raise an issue
to discuss what you want to do (without a discussion, we can't guarantee that
any contribution can actually be used).
<!--- You may want to update this section as the project evolves. -->

### Project structure

The project is very basic. 
We just have notebooks.
Run them in their numerical order.
An example scenario file
is included in the project so you know what input you need to bring.

### Tools

In this project, we use the following tools:

- git for version-control (for more on version control, see
  [general principles: version control](https://gitlab.com/znicholls/mullet-rse/-/blob/main/book/theory/version-control.md))
    - for these purposes, git is a great version-control system so we don't
      complicate things any further. For an introduction to Git, see
      [this introduction from Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment management
  (for more on environment management, see
  [general principles: environment management](https://gitlab.com/znicholls/mullet-rse/-/blob/main/book/theory/environment-management.md))
    - there are lots of environment management systems.
      uv works well in our experience.
    - we track the `uv.lock` file so that the environment
      is completely reproducible on other machines or by other people
      (e.g. if you want a colleague to take a look at what you've done)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) with some very basic settings to get some
  easy wins in terms of maintenance, specifically:
    - code formatting with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/)
    - basic file checks (removing unneeded whitespace, not committing large
      files etc.)
    - (for more thoughts on the usefulness of pre-commit, see
      [general principles: automation](https://gitlab.com/znicholls/mullet-rse/-/blob/main/book/general-principles/automation.md)
    - track your notebooks using
    [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
    (for more thoughts on the usefulness of Jupytext, see
    [tips and tricks: Jupytext](https://gitlab.com/znicholls/mullet-rse/-/blob/main/book/tips-and-tricks/managing-notebooks-jupytext.md))
        - this avoids nasty merge conflicts and incomprehensible diffs
